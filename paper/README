# Setup

## Tokens
Open the file `etc/tokens.json.initial` and fill out your mesowest token. NOTE: the earthdata token is not needed for this paper

## RAWS Stash
This paper retrieved RAWS data from a stash maintained by Angel Farguell Caus at WIRC, please reach out to corresponding author Jonathon Hirschi if you'd like access. If you choose to use Synoptic data, you will need a paid token to access old data and results may not be exact to the paper

The file `etc/paths.yaml` will store your location to the RAWS stash. Update that file and run the test below and check for a positive print message:

```
python tests/test_ingest_RAWS.py
```

## HRRR Retrieval

Run the following test to confirm HRRR data retrieval through the Herbie python package

```
python tests/test_ingest_HRRR.py
```

## Main project Config File
The configuration file `etc/rocky_config.yaml` contains the configuration instructions to repeat the analysis used in the paper. The relevant confirations are:
- `train_start`: set to first hour UTC of January 1st 2025. Used to define training period for ML models as well as for controlling the data retrieval process
- `train_end`: set to last hour of 2023 UTC, used to control training period for ML models.
- "f_start": when to start forecasting, set to first hour of 2024.
- "f_end": when to end forecasting, set to last hour of 2024. Also used to control data retrieval process
- "bbox": spatial bounding box, set to '[37,-111,46,-95]' to bracket all of Rocky Mountain GACC as determined by NIFC.
- `features_list`: list of features used as inputs to model, see directory `etc/variable_metadata` for more information on how these are constructed
- `baselines`: list of models used to compare forecast accuracy
- `data_dir`: location to save retrieved data used to construct training and testing sets
- `valid_path`: path to file that contains manual QC on FMC sensors for the rocky mountain region
- `climatology_file`: location of climatology that covers the study region and time period. The climatology is ran separately once so it can be reused for other applications, and it doesn't utilize a spatial holdout cross validation approach
- `n_reps`: number of replications with new random seeds of spatial sampling for test/train and random seeds for random weight initialization in RNN and XGBoost
- `space_test_frac`: percent of available RAWS to use for test set

# Data Retrieval Instructions
Data need to be retrieved from RAWS through Synopticpy and HRRR through Herbie. The config file described above controls this. To retrieve the data 

```
python src/ingest/get_fmda_data.py etc/rocky_config.yaml
```

Alternatively, if you have access to a computing cluster that uses a job scheduler such as Slurm, you can submit this script using:

```
sbatch build_fmda_data.sh etc/rocky_config.yaml
```

NOTE: this process could take several days depending on your computational resources.

# Run Forecast Analysis

Run the following below with your own output directory. NOTE: as of Nov 1 2025, I haven't written how to reproduce this step without a job scheduler, it would require manual running of hundreds of replication runs.

```
sbatch forecast_analysis_controller.sh /PATH_TO_OUTPUT/ etc/rocky_config.yaml
```

# Additional Metrics

The process above runs `src/forecast_eval.py` to general tables used in the paper. Additional tables are generated by running:

```
python src/report_materials.py /PATH_TO_OUTPUT/
```
