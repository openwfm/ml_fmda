# Metadata used to control which HRRR bands need to be retrieved given an input list of features

# There are 4 types of features used: HRRR modeled variables (e.g. wind speed), HRRR dimension variables (e.g. time), features engineered from HRRR modeled data (e.g. equilibrium moisture), and features engineered from HRRR dimension variables (e.g. hour of day). These 3 types will have different parameters associated with them. 
    # HRRR data variables features will specify HRRR naming convention, regex search string, and layer/level. Common layers are grouped together in data retrieval
    # HRRR dimension variables will specify a HRRR naming convention, but they can be read from any other set of HRRR data
    # Engineered features from HRRR data variables will specify the names of variables needed to calculate them. The names will exist as other top-level keys in this file
    # Engineered features from HRRR dimension variables will specify the names of the dimensions needed to calculate them
