# Path relative to root to manually constructed table for filtered invalid data
valid_path: "data/fmc_valid_rocky24.csv"

space_test_frac: 0.1 # Percentage of data based on location for val and test
train_hours: 8760 # hours in a 365 day year
forecast_hours: 48 # based on HRRR max forecast time


# Filter Params
# Assumed units: 
## FM: percent from 0-100 (or more)
## Rain: mm/hr
## Wind: m/s, see https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/guides/coast-and-sea/beaufort-scale
## Solar Rad: W/m^2, see https://viirsland.gsfc.nasa.gov/PDF/VIIRS_DSRPAR_UserGuide_v1.2.pdf
## Soil Moisture: % (fraction)
max_linear_time: 3 # maximum number of hours that can be perfectly linear, controls interpolation length
max_const_time: 3 # number of hours where flagged if zero change in a variable
hours: 72 # total hours to build timeseries, break up longer into this length. Used to help with filters related to over-interpolation
min_fm: 1 # minimum FMC value allowed (assumes scaled 0-100)
max_fm: 90 # maximum FMC value allowed (assumes scaled 0-100), see VanderKamp 2016 Table 1
min_rain: 0 # minimum rain value allowed
max_rain: 100 # maximum rain value allowed, assuming mm/hr units
min_wind: 0 # minimum wind threshold value
max_wind: 35 # maximum wind threshold value, this corresponds to a hurricane
min_solar: 0 # minimum wind threshold value
max_solar: 1400 # maximum solar threshold value
min_temp: 230 # Minimum air temp (K), corresponds to -43 C
max_temp: 330 # Maximum air temp (K), corresponds to 56 C (hottest recorded temp in Death Valley)
min_soilm: 0 # minimum soil moisture threshold value
# max_soilm: 0 # minimum soil moisture threshold value, TODO
