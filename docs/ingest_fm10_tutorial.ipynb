    "# Data Ingest of 10-h Fuel Moisture Content\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates retrieval and filtering of 10-h dead FMC data from RAWS. Retrieval of 10-h FMC observations is done with the software package `SynopticPy` and a stash of RAWS data kept and maintained by the broader OpenWFM community. This notebook will demonstrate use of `Synopticpy` with a free token, so limits are placed on the number of sensor hours that can be requested. Only records within the past year are freely available.\n",

    "The module `ingest/retrieve_raws_api.py` has an executable section and will be run from the command line within this project. Here, the functions are used individually to demonstrate their utility. \n",

    "The main steps in the retrieval are:\n",
    "* Use `synoptic.Metadata` to determine the RAWS with FMC data in the given spatial domain and time frame\n",
    "* Use `synoptic.Timeseries` to retrieve all available data that may be relevant to FMC modeling. *NOTE:* the stations are selected so they must have FMC data, and then any other available variables are collected as a bonus. These data are used for exploratory purposes and quality control checks, but predictors for final modeling comes from HRRR.\n",
    "* Format data and convert units.\n",
    "* Identify missing data and interpolate with linear interpolation from numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "The module has a main wrapper function `build_raws_dict` that puts all the steps together. In this module, we will demonstrate the individual steps with the module functions, and then run the main wrapper function at the end and check that it is all the same."

    "Timeseries of observations are drawn for a single RAWS using the `synopticpy` package. Then, the data are formatted by custom funcitons in the `retrieve_raws_api` module. We subtract one hour from the start time because most stations produce data some number of minutes after the requested time, so if you request data at 1:00 the API will return data after that time. Then the temporal interpolation procedure, described below, will be extrapolating out at end points. Shifting the start time by 1 hour accounts for this, but if the start time is longer than 1 year in the past the API will truncate to 1 year. The module has a metadata file with a list of all RAWS weather variables relevant to FMC modeling. \n",

    "The data is returned in \"long\" format, where each weather variable has its own row. We restructure the data into \"wide\" format with the module function `format_raws` so that a single row corresponds to one time, and the columns correspond to different data variables. Additionally, this function converts units and returns a dictionary of all units for the variables"
