    "RAWS utilize rainfall capture buckets that measure hourly rainfall in millimeters (LINK RAWS RAIN BUCKET). A first difference, or a lag-1 difference, will therefore convert this to units of $mm/hr$. The HRRR acumulated precipitation is in units of $kg/m^{2}$. The difference between the f02 and f03 forecast hours is calculated to get the accumulated rainfall over an hour, so we take the difference of two $kg/m^2$ to get the accumulated rainfall in 1 hour."
